# Volunteer Login Testing Guide

## Current Status
âœ… **Volunteer Login System Implemented**

The volunteer login system is now fully functional with the following features:

## Demo Credentials (Development Phase)

Since the admin panel is still in development, we've implemented dummy credentials for testing:

```
Email: admin@kumbhrakshak.com
Password: admin123
```

## How to Test

### 1. First Time App Launch
- When you open the app for the first time, you'll see the **User Type Selection** modal
- Two options are available:
  - **General User** - Normal app usage
  - **Volunteer** - Requires login

### 2. Testing Volunteer Login
1. Click on **"Volunteer"** option
2. The **Volunteer Login Modal** will appear
3. Enter the demo credentials:
   - Email: `admin@kumbhrakshak.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. Click **"Sign In"**
5. After successful login, you'll be logged in as a volunteer

### 3. Testing User Flow
1. Click on **"General User"** option
2. Fill in registration form (name and phone)
3. Complete registration and use app normally

## Features Implemented

## Development Notes

### Current Implementation
- Uses dummy credentials for testing
- All volunteer logic is in place
- Data storage working correctly
- State management implemented

### When Backend is Ready
The volunteer authentication can be easily connected to your admin panel by:

1. Replacing the dummy credentials check in `VolunteerLoginModal.jsx`
2. Adding actual API call to your backend
3. Handling real authentication tokens
4. Connecting to admin-assigned credential system

### Code Location
- **User Type Selection**: `components/UserTypeModal.jsx`
- **Volunteer Login**: `components/VolunteerLoginModal.jsx`
- **App Flow Logic**: `App.js`
- **Data Management**: `utils/UserStorage.js`

## Testing Reset

To test the full flow again:
1. Go to Home screen
2. Scroll down and click **"Reset Registration (Debug)"** button
3. App will clear all data
4. Restart the app to see User Type Selection again
